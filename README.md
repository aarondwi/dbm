ORM-style database-schema migration tools, minus the ORM bloats

Why?
--------------------------
I am persoanlly not a fan of ORM tools, IMO that increase bloats without any benefits.
But the migration tool model is really nice. Easy to both track and version controlled.
So I made this. Provide usual goodies of ORM database-schema migration, without the ORM
